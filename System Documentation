    Authentication: Integrates Django's built-in authentication system for user registration, login, and logout.

Frontend

    HTML Templates: Utilizes HTML templates rendered by Django views to generate dynamic web pages.
    CSS and JavaScript: Enhances user interface and interactivity using custom CSS styles and JavaScript code.
    AJAX: Implements asynchronous requests for dynamic content loading and interaction without full page reloads.

Usage

    Accessing Features: Users can access various features through the navigation menu or dedicated URLs provided by the application.
    Authentication: Users need to register and log in to access certain features requiring authentication.
    Data Management: Authorized users can add, edit, or delete data as necessary, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
    Report Generation: Reports can be generated to analyze data and make informed decisions.

## Future Enhancements

    Implement additional features such as production reports, pricing reports, and shopping lists.
